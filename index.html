	<p>Football can unite people like nothing else. However, the beautiful game isn’t free from imperfections and racism continues to happen on and off the pitch. One of the biggest problems is the amount of incidents that go unreported. Countless people have experienced or witnessed racist abuse but never challenged it, including myself…

				<p style="    font-size: 0.8rem;line-height: 1.5rem;">
				<i>In January 2018, Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly was another footballer who was subjected to racism whilst on the pitch, with Atlanta fans shouting racist chants from the crowd. In consideration of the incident, Atlanta received a suspended one-game stand closure, but this punishment seems to have inflicted little change.</i></p>

				<p><b>One month later</b>, Borussia Dortmund’s Belgian striker <b>Michy Batshuayi </b>  currentlyon loan from Chelsea and the Belgium National Team was a victim of racist abuse, this was during the match that saw Borussia Dortmund beat Atlanta 4-3 on aggregate, knocking them out of the Europa League. </p>

			<p>Batshuayi was left distressed after the game and tweeted: </p>

			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2018 and still racists monkey noises in the stands ... really ?! 🤦🏾‍♂️ hope you have fun watching the rest of <a href="https://twitter.com/EuropaLeague?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EuropaLeague</a> on TV while we are through 🙊🙈🙉 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SayNoToRacism?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SayNoToRacism</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoWatchBlackPanther?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GoWatchBlackPanther</a> ✌🏾</p>&mdash; Michy Batshuayi (@mbatshuayi) <a href="https://twitter.com/mbatshuayi/status/966795800209747968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2018</a></blockquote>



			<p>

			Batshuayi’s complaint encouraged UEFA to launch an investigation into the incident later the claims of discriminatory behavior were dropped. Batshuayi was upset about the decision and tweeted:</p>
			 
	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">LOL.

			<p>If the accusation the striker made was true then this outcome is obviously disappointing for the victim and many others. Racism is still a big issue and measures have been put in place to try and tackle the problem within football. The support networks encourage people to come forward with their complaints, however if investigations are dropped this will surely effect people’s belief in the system.

					<h2> Rhian Brewster vs Spartak captain </h2><br>
				<p style="    font-size: 0.8rem;line-height: 1.5rem;">
				<i>Throughout one season Liverpool made two complaints in relation to racist abuse from Spartak. The first incident was in relation to Bobby Adekanye who received abuse from the Spartak fans whilst the two teams met in Moscow, the supporters were giving inappropriate gestures and singing racist chants. In response to this incident UEFA closed 500 seats at the next home fixture and instructed the club to display a banner which read ‘Equal Game’. Although this result and response from UEFA can allow us to stay hopeful that the issue of racism is being taken more seriously, not every case ends this way. The second of the Liverpool reports within the season was not so successful. </i></p>

				<p>Liverpool’s youngster <b>Rhian Brewster</b> claimed that the <b>Spartak captain Mironov</b>stood over him during the game and said to him <b>“Suck my ****, you ******, you *****.” </b>Brewster became immediately angry over the insult and his fellow team mates had to force him away from the incident. Liverpool filed a complaint to UEFA, however after many months of deliberation the charges were dropped. </p>

			<p>

	If Brewster’s complaint was true then this result would seem unfair. </p>

	<p>

	Kick It Out said that their <b>“organisation is deeply disappointed with the findings of the independent investigation, with this outcome likely to give further encouragement to those who wish to be abusive in the sport”</b>. This point is worrying as it is evident that a lack of evidence can sometimes dismiss a complaint, this can therefore potentially put people off from reporting these types of incidents.
</p>
			 

			<p>Despite this, <b>Klopp</b> said he was <b>"very proud of the maturity, dignity and leadership Rhian has displayed in bringing focus to this issue and he will continue to receive our full support"</b>. The varied range of outcomes that these incidents have are both positive and negative. Quotes from the football clubs and governing bodies suggest that a conscious effort is being made to tackle the issue but problems can be presented in the prosecution if there is a lack of evidence. 
			</p>

			<p>
				This can be overwhelming for the victim and may lead them to handle the situations on their own, which could affect them in a number of ways. It has become clear that whilst racism in football is currently being taken more seriously, it is very important for the issue to be considered further so that the number of incidents lower or more of them are resolved.

				<p style="    font-size: 0.8rem;line-height: 1.5rem;">
				<i>Sometimes it is easy to forget that behind the glamour of a footballer’s life there is a real person and that it is their job to play football. In addition to the matches they are also required to attend training sessions. No one would expect to turn up for work and be attacked, verbally or physically.</i></p>

				<p>However, this was the case for <b>Raheem Sterling.</b></p>

			

				<p><b>Karl Anderson</b>, 29, who had previous convictions for 37 offences, including throwing flares at police officers whilst at a football match reportedly carried out a truly “unprovoked attack” on the Manchester City player. </p>

				<p>CCTV showed Anderson approaching Sterling, kicking him four times. The prosecutor, Carl Miles said that Anderson continuously shouted racial abuse at Sterling, calling him <b>“you black scouse cunt”</b> and telling him <b>“I hope that your mother and child wake up dead in the morning, you nigger”</b>. After the Manchester City v Tottenham match later that day, Sterling said he was <b>“completely shocked” </b>and <b>“I didn’t think this type of behavior still happened in this country in this day and age”</b>. </p>
			 

				<p>Whilst in court it was claimed that Anderson was angry after his girlfriend had asked him to get Sterling’s autograph, he said that he “bitterly” regretted his behavior and pleaded guilty. Anderson was jailed for 16 weeks and order to pay £100 compensation and a £115 victim surcharge.

					<h2> Anton Ferdinand vs John Terry</h2><br>
				<p style="    font-size: 0.8rem;line-height: 1.5rem;">
				<i>It cannot be said that racist comments come solely from the fans, sometimes the players are brought under the spot light too. </i></p>

				<p>This was the case between the defenders <b>John Terry</b> and <b> Anton Ferdinand</b> during the Queens Park Rangers v Chelsea match on 23 October 2011. The players had a disagreement during the 85th minute of a football game which then led to a lengthy investigation process and punishment for Terry.</p>

			

				<p>The argument started over a penalty claim when Chelsea had just 9 players remaining on the pitch. The two players began to hurl insults at each other and Ferdinand claimed that Terry had barged him in the back for no reason. The insults become very personal, with Ferdinand also making a remark in regards to John Terry allegedly having an affair with Wayne Bridge’s girlfriend, Vanessa Perroncel.After this it was reported that Terry called Ferdinand a <b>“fucking black cunt”</b>.</p>

				<p>After the match QPR made a complaint to the FA. There was also a video circulating that reportedly shown Terry being racist. During the court process at Westminster Magistrates Court Terry said that there had been confusion of what he had said and that there had been a mistake. He said that he had mimicked what Ferdiand had said and stated <b>"I was very angry and I was upset. I replied 'a black cunt, you fucking knobhead'"</b>. </p>
			 

				<p>Throughout the court process England Manager Fabio Capello announced that Terry would still be a member of the England squad. Terry continued to play but was forced to retire from international football after his injury. Following this, Terry was cleared at Westminster Magistrates Court but is charged by the FA. Terry was banned for four matches and given a £220,000 fine. Overall the panel decided that Terry is <b>“not a racist”</b>.
